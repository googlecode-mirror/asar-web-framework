## Simplicity ##

  * Using the framework to create a working web application or website should only require you to know the languages that an average php programmer would know: PHP and HTML. That same programmer shouldn't need to learn a different language like YAML (although that's easy to learn), or XML just to do stuff.
  * Configuring a website should be easy. It should be written in PHP as well. The framework should handle the defaults and the developer need only configure things that make his / her web application unique.
  * As little code generation please.

## Interface First ##

  * Strive to make the interface intuitive and coherent. Invest judiciously on it. Worry about the implementations later.
  * If an interface doesn't quite look right, think of something better or just remove it if it's not that important.

## Law of Demeter ##

  * (define LOD here)

## Well-tested ##

  * Follow TDD.


## RESTful ##

  * Controllers are resources.
  * Views are representations of resources.
  * Use content-negotiation
  * Pretty URLs out of the box!
